        "- **Convergence**:\n",
        "  - ReLU often leads to faster convergence due to its non-saturating gradient.\n",
        "  - Sparse activations improve computational efficiency.\n",
        "- **Performance**:\n",
        "  - Performs well on deeper networks and large datasets.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### **2. Sigmoid**\n",
        "- **Convergence**:\n",
        "  - Convergence is slower because gradients become small (saturating) for large positive or negative values of input.\n",

        "  - Converges faster than sigmoid because its output is zero-centered, reducing the bias in gradient updates.\n",
        "  - Still suffers from the vanishing gradient problem but to a lesser extent than sigmoid.\n",
